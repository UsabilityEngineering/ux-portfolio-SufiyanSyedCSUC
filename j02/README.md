# TCL Roku TV Remote 
### By Sufiyan Syed - 4/15/22

*Crrack Booom!* Rumbling can be heard in the distance as a thunderstorm begins to antagonize me on my walk back home from class. My 5:00 O’clock friday class just ended and I can’t wait to get home to relax for the rest of the day. After navigating the rising puddles and speeding cars, I open my apartment door to see my roommates watching YouTube on the TV. 

I say “What’s Up”, run to my room and hurl my backpack onto my bed. I grab a drink from the fridge, place myself comfortably on the couch and begin to watch highlights of a recent Golden State Warriors NBA game with my roommates.

“You guys see Jordan Poole’s career high game a few weeks ago? He scored like 50 points” I said. “No way 50 points! Here play it” my roommate says as he throws the TV remote across the room while imitating shooting a basketball.

I press the *home* button to return to the *YouTube homepage*

“Oops wrong button” I say as I *click OK* to return to the *YouTube homepage*

I press *Left, Up, and OK* to access the *search bar*

I begin to use the *Left, Right, Up, Down arrow buttons* to *spell out “Jordan Poole 50 Points”*

One letter after another, I find and press OK. 

In my head I repeat *J . . . J . . . J . . . *as I finally navigate to the letter and *click OK*

I continue 

*O . . .O . . . O . . . click OK* 

*R . . . R . . . R . . . click OK*

*D . . . D . . . D . . . click OK*

20 seconds goes by and I managed to *spell “Jordan P”* on the *Youtube Search bar.*

Again I repeat in my head *O . . . O . . . O*

Overconfidently I *click OK* too early and accidentally chose *P* again. 

“Not P, O!” I think in frustration. I then spam the *back* button on the remote, mistaking it with *backspace.* 

The screen returns to the *Home tab* completely erasing my search bar.

“Dammit!” I scream in anger. “Let me just show you on my phone” I tell my roommate as I find the video on the YouTube mobile app and *click play*.

#### Interaction Reflection 

[insert photo of remote labeled] 

The experience in the interaction above highlights its deficiencies in the interface regarding its Usability. In terms of **efficiency**, the configuration of the UI results in you taking far too much time typing. In this interaction, typing gets so time-consuming, tedious and **unsatisfying** that I begin to lose attention. This collectively results in a diminishing **error tolerance** as I give up on using the device when I make an error and my search bar is erased. 

In addition the remote’s UI is not optimized for navigation within apps. For example I would frequently confuse the Home Icon on the interface with the Home Icon on the Youtube app, thinking it would direct me to the home screen of the app rather than the home screen of the TV. Having the remote interface better designed for use within apps would result in increased **efficiency**. 

Particularly to the TV and the Youtube app, the interface is not very efficient and useful when using the TV with others. For example sharing content with others or having multiple users being able to add to a queue is overlooked in this interface. On the Youtube mobile app, access to a previously watched video is seamless with the liked videos and history features. The TV Youtube app does allow you to sign in to a single Youtube account, but having to sign in to a youtube account to access a previously watched video is **inefficient**, especially if you are using a TV in someone else's house. In the interaction above, instead of signing into the app on the TV I chose to just use my phone because it was more faster and easier. Including a feature on the remote to allow easier sharing of content with others would be useful for using the Youtube app specifically. 

#### Conclusion 

Other than pause/play and browsing through content with the arrow keys, using a search bar is one of the most common things I find myself doing on this device. For this reason, It's perplexing to see it being completely neglected with an absence of a backspace or spacebar button. The remote has two ways to pause/play with the OK and >II buttons; and two features to skip/rewind with the Left/Right arrow and <</>> buttons. Having duplicate buttons for the same action is a poor design decision when features to help typing and searching could have been added instead.
